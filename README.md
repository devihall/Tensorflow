# TensorFlow-project- a smart webcam with TensorFlow.js pretrained machine learning model

## Site
 [TensorFlow-project]([https://pages.github.com/](https://devihall.github.io/tensorflow-project/)

## Description
A webpage that uses machine learning directly in the web browser via TensorFlow.js to classify and detect common objects, (yes, including more than one at a time), from a live webcam stream.
This can supercharge your regular webcam to identify objects and get the coordinates of the bounding box for each object it finds, and highlights the found object in the video stream, as shown below:
